algorithm
=================
project for university

At first we were asked to create a simple analog algorithm, that people from the class should execute. Improving our algorithm and let it be executed by atleast 10 people was the goal forthe next few lessons.

I choose to create a simple algorithm that was composed of different-colored lines.

After finishing the work on the analog algorith our task was to make a digital version of said algorithm with processing. My first algorithm was so basic and simple, that I choose to do another algorithm for the digital version.

This time the algorithm was composed of circles, that would circle around each other in a specific pattern.
